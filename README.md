In this course we learn about Ethereum, which  one of the leading blockchain platforms, transitioned from a Proof of Work consensus mechanism to a Proof of Stake mechanism.
In this course we learn about the mechanism process of etherium : In this , miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency.
We learn about the security of this course :  It is highly secure due to the computational power required to solve the puzzles, making it difficult and expensive to attack the network.
